# C Programming for Beginners - Master the C Language

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions
for Section 8 of C Programming for Beginners: Master the C Language
by Jason Fedin, which covers arrays, i.e., one-dimenstional arrays,
multi-dimenstional arrays, and variable length arrays.

See the following link for this course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginner-/" title="C Programming" target="_blank">C Programming for Beginners</a>

<i>This repository is currently a work in progress and new material
will be added over time, if need be.</i>

In this repository, I incorporated Code::Blocks Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) and the Vim text editor along with Git and GitHub into
my workflow. I also used the Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox environment
to create, use, and manage directories and files as I worked through the
section.

Please feel free to reach out to me at devildoc300@gmail.com if you have
any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the source
code for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, build, and execute the Section 8 files and directories,

    (1) click on the blue "Code" button above and click the 
        "Download Zip" link, or
    (2) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example
    (3) and either compile, build, and execute the files in your 
        IDE, or
    (4) use the following command-line script:

            $ gcc name_of_file.c -o main
            $ ./main
